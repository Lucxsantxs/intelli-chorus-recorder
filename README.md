Intelli Chorus Recorder is a powerful REAPER script designed to automate and streamline the process of recording layered vocals, harmonies, or instrumental doubles. It is built from the ground up with accessibility as a primary focus, ensuring full compatibility with screen readers like NVDA and JAWS via OSARA.

This new modular version is an open-source project, inviting community contributions to make it even better.

Features
Step-by-Step Guided Setup: An accessible wizard guides you through every setting, eliminating confusion.

Session Persistence: Save your settings (track count, panning, etc.) and load them instantly on the next run.

Automated Track Creation: Automatically creates, names, and numbers tracks for you.

Intelligent Panning: Spreads your tracks across the stereo field automatically based on your preference.

Hands-Free Punch Recording: Just set a time selection and the script handles the punch-in and punch-out for every take.

Full Accessibility: Provides clear, spoken feedback at every step of the process.

Workflow Options: Includes popular features like muting previous takes, folder organization, and auto-saving.

Installation
This script is distributed as a complete folder.

Download the Intelli Chorus Recorder folder.

In REAPER, navigate to the Options menu and select "Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder...".

Open the Scripts folder.

Copy the entire Intelli Chorus Recorder folder into this Scripts folder.

In REAPER, open the Action List (Actions > Show action list...).

Click the "New action..." button and then "Load ReaScript...".

Navigate into the Intelli Chorus Recorder folder and select the main.lua file.

The script is now in your Action List. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to it for easy access.

How to Use
Create a Time Selection: In your REAPER project, create a time selection that covers the part you want to record (e.g., the chorus). This is a mandatory step.

Run the Script: Trigger the script using its keyboard shortcut or by running it from the Action List.

Follow the Wizard:

If it's your first time, a setup wizard will appear, asking you questions one by one (e.g., "How many tracks?", "What is the track name?").

If you have run the script before, it will ask if you want to use your previously saved settings.

Record: Once the setup is complete, the script will arm the first track and begin recording. Sing or play along with your part.

Repeat: The script will automatically stop, arm the next track, and start recording again. Repeat this process for all takes.

Done! When all tracks are recorded, the script will notify you. All your takes will be perfectly aligned and organized in the timeline.

We hope this tool enhances your creative workflow. Happy recording!
